# Array-

## Reflection 
```

  One difference when it comes to Arrays and individual variables is that individual variables can only store 1 value, while
a array can store multiple values that are the same type. With there being multiple values being able to be stored in an
array you access them differently. Like in a list you type the corresponding number to the item in the list you want and you
can retrieve it, unlike Individual variable, where you only have the one item to access you can jus type in the variable to
access it. When it comes to zero based indexing I think it's a little odd to start at zero when counting out items in the list.
I don't know if there is a solid reason or meaning behind it in the history of coding, but it's not a problem, just a odd
specification.
  The big difference between Arrays and Objects is the data types that they store. Arrays are good for numbers, while arrays
are good for strings. What I find interesting is that an array is an object, but objects are not arrays. I find this neat
while doing the examples and seeing what that means and how that works. When adding things onto an existing object like in the
person example, I find it very easy to do. You don't have to re-do anything or get rid of the original properties to add new
ones. It's very simple and easy to do. I really enjoy the undefined behavior aspect of JavaScript. When writing code before and
miss typing something or trying to search for something and I look for something that's not there, itcan really mess up a
program or my coding. SO just having JavaScript tell me undefined is nice, and takes off the stress of messing up.
